## HANGMAN GAME Using Statistical n-gram Model

# Description
            
1. The repo contains training examples in the file named as training.txt, 
   along with python files named as hangman.py, guess.py and finally the 
   file named as your_sol.py.
2. hangman.py contains the code for the hangman game to run, while the 
   guess.py file contains suggest_next_letter and play_move functions 
   for evaluating the response. your_sol.py contains the code for the 
   n-gram statistical model that goes upto the fourgram guesser function
   and returns the guess for the next letter.
3. The main code runs from the hangman.py file as it contains the driver 
   function named as hangman that takes the testing file and the guesser 
   function to guess the word and uses the guess.py file as the evaluator.
